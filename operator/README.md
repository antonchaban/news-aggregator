# operator
Operator for managing the lifecycle of a custom resource in a Kubernetes cluster. 
Source resource is a custom resource that is created by the user. The operator watches for the creation/update/deletion of the custom resource and takes appropriate actions in news aggregator service.

## Description
Source CRD is used for creating sources which will be maintained by news aggregator service.
if a user creates Source â€” it creates new sources in the news-aggregator;
if a user updates Source - it updates corresponding source in the news-aggregator;
