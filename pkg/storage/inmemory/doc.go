// Package inmemory provides an in-memory data storage implementation.
// This package is designed for scenarios where a lightweight, fast, and
// transient storage solution is required. It is suitable for testing,
// development, and applications that do not require persistent storage.
//
// Note: As this package stores data in memory, all stored data will be lost when the application is stopped.
